		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Born in the Philippines. Raised in LA. Schooled in the Bay. I'm a UX Architect, Product Manager and DJ. As a Sociology major at UC Berkeley, I developed a keen interest in the unseen forces that affect the way people think and behave. This is the lens through which I think about most things, including my passions for information technology, user experience, non-profit work and music.
